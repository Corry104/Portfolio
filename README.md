# My personal portfolio built completey using React.js

#### *I chose React as it was one of my latest technologies learnt during my bootcamp experience.*
#### *This is a summary of my personal and work experience and it will be updated as I progress my career as a Software Engineer.* 

###### *Inside my portfolio under the page "Resume" you can see my work history, under the page "About Me" you will get to know my personal story and under the "Projects" page you can take a look and play with some of the projects I worked on in the past. Lastly, in my "Contact" page you can send me an email and share your feedback about my portfolio or any other projects you think may need an improvement. You can also shoot me an email if you think I could be a great fit for your company and your team!*

###### This project is hosted on Heroku
